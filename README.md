# Basic-Portfolio
Homework 02, Responsive Portfolio

Created a basic portfolio using with three pages using Bootstrap and my own CSS. It is responsive, although not as responsive on smaller screens as I would like for it to be. 

I worked through a bunch of stuck points to get it to where the project is now and look forward to some feedback on how to make it do the things it still doesn't do.
